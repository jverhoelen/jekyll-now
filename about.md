My name is Jonas and I am working as an IT Consultant and Software Engineer at [codecentric AG](https://codecentric.de) in Solingen. I love working with technologies from the Java and JavaScript ecosystems and to learn new things. Especially I am fired up for agile, communicative and productive working atmospheres â€“ Maker Mindset over meetings.
Besides working for customers, I am discovering the world of blockchain, smart contracts, IoT/micro-payments and cryptocurrencies. I see a chance for it to become a part of our future and a better world.

I love my profession, company and everything around it so I started this tiny blog to write about my opinions, experiences and solutions from time to time.
