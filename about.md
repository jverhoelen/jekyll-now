Hello! My name is Jonas. Currently I work as an IT consultant and software developer at [codecentric AG](https://www.codecentric.de) in Solingen. I am passionate about solving problems related to software and people. The search for the right approach to solving problems puzzles me on a technological, human and organizational level. On the path of eternal learning I prefer to work in communicative, open and bright teams. Agile and maker mindset over meetings, flat hierarchies over leading positions and ivory towers - that is where I feel safe and productive.

### Let's speak tech

Technologically, I am somewhere between modern JVM languages and the JavaScript & TypeScript universe. I prefer a good mix of object-oriented and functional programming and stand in for Clean Code. Since I strongly believe in ideas like T-Shaped People and DevOps, I work in the backend, frontend as well as the infrastructure and delivery of software. I like to work with technologies such as React, Node.js, Spring, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, GitlabCI, Travis and many more.

### InfoSec

I've been interested in information security since I caught the first keylogger from an ICQ contact back then. Not much has changed since then. IT systems still have lots of tricky vulnerabilities that developers have to pay the utmost attention to. Especially when software tends to be developed faster and faster nowadays. That's why I attach great importance to sensitizing teams to IT security, consolidating the basics and taking appropriate countermeasures against cyber security threats in an iterative approach. Ethical hacking helps me to understand acute threats and motivations of hackers and to take countermeasures in application development.

### Blockchain everywhere

The topic around blockchain, distributed ledger technology and Bitcoin has fascinated me since the beginning of 2016. Even though it is mostly controversially discussed and misunderstood, I am still interested in the motivation and technical challenge behind decentralized systems and even crypto currencies. Should this technology mean only one percent more fairness, transparency or privacy in our complicated world, I will be satisfied. Although I am interested in blockchain, I do not call myself an enthusiast, evangelist or anything like that.

I spend a lot of my free time with electric guitars, heavy metal music and sports (fitness and biking). I value my girlfriend, family & friends a lot and also try to spend a lot of time with them. Inside me I would like to save the world very often. I practice eating little meat and reducing garbage in order to contribute at least a small part to saving the world.
