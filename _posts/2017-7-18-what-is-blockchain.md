Blockchain fuels digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and a lot more. FinTech companies and startups started to utilize Blockchain to disrupt the classic financial industry. Also more institutes and governments are doing research and start interesting projects.

But what is it and how does it work? What advantages and disadvantages does it have? How can we use it in IT and business?

<strong>I got curious about this topic a few months ago and wrote a blog post for codecentric: [Blockchain, the next big thing?](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/07/what-is-blockchain/)</strong>

It is [also available in German](https://blog.codecentric.de/2017/07/was-ist-blockchain/).
