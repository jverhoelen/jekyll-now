Decentralized Autonomous Organization is a new kind of organization that emerged from the blockchain technology. It's a way of organizing various stakeholders, their financial interactions and processes that can be used in the organization.

Currently there are few real world examples since the ideas is relatively new. Still the idea seems to gain some interesting developments and should be kept in sight because it could serve some advantages for some organizations.

You can find my article on the codecentric blog: [Decentralized Autonomous Organization – Organizations on the Blockchain](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/09/decentralized-autonomous-organization-blockchain/).
