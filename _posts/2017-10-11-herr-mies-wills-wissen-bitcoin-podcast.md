title: "(GER) Herr Mies will's wissen #9 â€“ Bitcoin Podcast"
---

[Daniel Mies](https://twitter.com/danielmies), one of my great workmates at [codecentric AG](https://codecentric.de), invited me to join his German podcast "Herr Mies will's wissen" for an episode on an [introduction to Bitcoin](https://mies.me/2017/10/11/hmww09-bitcoin/). As I worked pretty much with Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency related analysis the past months, I of course accepted and joined Daniel. More than half an hour we had a nice talk about it on a pretty basic level. For all of you guys that want to understand what Bitcoin basically is about, this episode might be interesting.

Give Daniel a follow on his podcast if you understand or speak German: [Herr Mies will's wissen](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/herr-mies-wills-wissen/id1257454170).<br />You will get to the notes and audio file of the mentioned episode [here](https://mies.me/2017/10/11/hmww09-bitcoin/). Have fun!
